# pong-wasm

Pong created with WebAssembly. Compiled with Emscripten. Inspired by [this article by Michael Bebenita](https://medium.com/@mbebenita/lets-write-pong-in-webassembly-ac3a8e7c4591).

[Online demo](https://jkumara.github.io/pong-wasm/). Control paddles with `WA` and `↑↓`. Works on browsers with [native WebAssembly support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=wasm).
